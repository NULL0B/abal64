The <b>Tree View</b> tool of the ABAL 3 development environment provides a hierarchical

view of all projects and their various components.<p>
The tree view controlled by
the global menu option <b>View TreeView</b>. 
Selection of this menu option toggles
the state of the tree viewer between visible or hidden.<p>
The tree view display area
may be redimensioned by draggin the left edge of its scroll bar
to the required position.<p>
The
tree view may not be redimensioned nor its state be toggled whilst the internal text
editor
is active.<p>
The section of the treeview to be made visible may be selected by means
of its scroll bar.
A click on the top button will cause the viewer to scroll up by
one item, whilst a click
on the bottom button will cause the viewer to scroll down
by one item.
The bar may be dragged to the required position holding either the left
button or the
right button. In the first case a <b>quick scroll</b> operation will
occur but will the
last item of the tree to the bottom of the treeview zone.
In the
second case, with the right button, a <b>lazy scroll</b> operation will occur with
the
last item allowed to moce freely from the bottom edge.<p>
By clicking on an individual
item it will become the current tree view item. If it has
subordinate components then
the list will be opened and displayed in the tree view. A
further click on the item
will close its component list.<p>
The remainder of this document will be describe
the behaviour of the various components
of the actual treeview list.

<dt class=type><a name="ConfigurationIcon">
<b>ConfigurationIcon

<dd class=data>This treeview component icon represents the ABAL development environment configuration.
The

easy
identification of the current configuration.<p>
A click on this icon or its label
with the right button of the mouse will give access to
the <a href="vrefer.htm">Configuration

<dd class=data>This icon represents an ABAL 3 project and its subordinate collection of components.
Initially
one such icon is added to represent the startup project. 
The textual label will indicate
the project filename of the project controlled by the 
project icon. <p>
Subsequent
projects
may be opened via the global menu option <b>File Open</b> giving rise, upon
completion to 
new icons on the tree view list.
Projects may also be dropped from
the list via the global menu option <b>File Drop</b>.<p>
The project icon may be dragged
into the desktop area by pressing the left button and
moving the mouse into the destop
area abd then releasing the mouse button. In this case
the project will become the
current contents of the 
<a href="singproj.htm">Application Project 3D Editor Tool</a><p>

<dt class=type><a name="WidgetIcon">
<b>WidgetIcon

<dd class=data>These icons represent the component parts of their parent visual forms or document

its instance name and the names of the scenario integration methods that have been
defined.<p>
A click with the right button of the mouse gives direct access to the
<a href="vwidget.htm">
Widget Properties</a> dialog box for the selected widget allowing
consultation and
modification of its various properties.<p>
A click with either button

The order in which
widgets are defined in forms models of of great importance.<p>
Widgets will be instanced,
constructed and displayed in their declared order.<p>
They will receive focus in an
intial lly sequentiel manner.<p>
Their disappearance and eventual destruction will
occur in the reverse order of their

declarative order.<p>
